This is a project I made that uses the K-Means machine learning algorithm to classify hand-written digits. This algorithm uses 8X8 photos of handwritten digits where the values of the pixels range from 0 to 16. The algorithm begins by initializing 10 random centroids (one centroid for each of the distinct digits from 0 to 9) and assigns each datapoint (each photo of a handwritten digit) to the nearest centroid. The values of each centroid's coordinates are then updated to be the mean of the all its assigned data points. The data points are updated to be assigned to the new nearest centroid as all the centroids' coordinates have changed, and again the centroids' coordinates are updated to be the mean of all of their assigned data points. This process continues until the coordinates of the centroids converge and stabilize. Once the algorithm finishes finding the optimal values for the centroids, new handwritten digits can then be predicted by comparing their pixel coordinates with those of the nearest centroid.
